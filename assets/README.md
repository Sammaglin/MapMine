Perfect 👍 A detailed **README** is what makes a GitHub repo look professional.
Here’s a **well-structured README** for your `MapMine` project:

# 🗺️ MapMine – OSM Feature Extractor

MapMine is a desktop GIS application built with **Python, Tkinter, and OSMnx** that allows users to extract, visualize, and export OpenStreetMap (OSM) features such as **roads, buildings, parks, and water bodies** for any selected Area of Interest (AOI).

With its clean modern UI and interactive visualization, MapMine bridges the gap between **ease of use** and **powerful spatial data extraction**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 **Search Area of Interest (AOI)**

  * Search by **place name** (e.g., "Delhi, India")
  * Or provide **bounding box coordinates**

* 🗂️ **Select OSM Features**

  * Roads 🛣️
  * Buildings 🏠
  * Parks & Green Spaces 🌳
  * Water Bodies 💧

* 📊 **Interactive Visualization**

  * Preview extracted data using **matplotlib**
  * Toggle features on/off

* 💾 **Export Options**

  * Save data as **GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV**
  * Auto-organized outputs

* 🎨 **Modern User Interface**

  * Collapsible sidebar for maximizing map space
  * Tabbed interface for **AOI, Features, and Export**
  * Status bar with live progress updates

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the app with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

1. Enter **AOI name** or **bounding box coordinates**
2. Select features you want to extract
3. Click **Fetch & Visualize**
4. Save outputs in your preferred format
